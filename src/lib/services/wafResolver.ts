/**
 * Opens a dialog WebView so the user can solve a WAF / captcha challenge
 * (e.g. Cloudflare) for the given URL.
 *
 * This is exposed to providers via `providerContext.openWebView`. A provider
 * that detects a WAF response should call this with the blocked URL and the
 * request headers it would normally use (passed via `options.headers`), then
 * await the result. The WebView loads the page with those headers; once the
 * challenge is solved the provider receives the page response (rendered HTML)
 * in `result.data` along with the page cookies.
 *
 * Shortcuts:
 *  - If `options.waitForCookie` is already present for the URL, it resolves
 *    immediately with the existing cookies and does NOT open the dialog
 *    (`result.data` is empty in this case).
 *  - If `options.force` is set, the dialog is always opened (the shortcut
 *    above is skipped). The dialog still auto-closes as soon as the awaited
 *    cookie is present.
 *
 * The returned promise:
 *  - resolves with the page response (`data`) and cookies (including httpOnly
 *    cookies) once the user taps "Done" or the optional `waitForCookie` is
 *    detected.
 *  - rejects if the user cancels the dialog or the optional `timeoutMs` elapses.
 *
 * Cookies are read from and saved to the cookie jar of `author` (the
 * provider's source author), never another author's.
